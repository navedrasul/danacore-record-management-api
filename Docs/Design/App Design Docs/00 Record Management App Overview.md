**High-Level Overview Document**

## Record Management App Overview

### 1. Introduction
The Record Management App is a core component of the DanaCore ERP system, designed to enable efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for key business entities such as customers, employees, and inventory. This document outlines the high-level objectives, scope, requirements, and key workflows for the app, providing a foundation for detailed requirements documentation.

### 2. Objectives
- Establish a robust foundation for data management within the DanaCore ERP ecosystem.
- Provide end-users with a user-friendly interface for managing records.
- Ensure data consistency, accuracy, and security across all modules.
- Support scalability and adaptability for diverse SME requirements.

### 3. Scope
#### In-Scope Functionalities
- CRUD operations for Customers, Employees, and Inventory.
- Role-based access control for data management.
- Search and filter functionality for efficient data retrieval.
- Dynamic validation for data integrity.
- Audit trail tracking for compliance and traceability.
- Integration with the Configuration Management App for custom workflows.

#### Out-of-Scope Functionalities
- Advanced analytics or predictive insights (covered by Analytical Apps).
- Domain-specific operational functionalities (handled by Operational Apps).
- Third-party integrations (covered by Integration Apps).

### 4. High-Level Requirements
#### Core Functionalities
1. **Customer Management**
   - Add, update, delete, and view customer records.
   - Search and filter customer data based on criteria like name, email, and region.

2. **Employee Management**
   - Manage employee records including personal details, job roles, and department assignments.
   - Enable role-based filtering and search options.

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Maintain records of products, stock levels, and restocking details.
   - Support alerts for low inventory levels.

#### Security Requirements
- Implement JWT-based authentication for all API access.
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
- Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks using both frontend and backend validation.

#### Data Integrity and Validation
- Ensure unique constraints (e.g., unique customer email).
- Validate input data using frontend libraries (e.g., React Hook Form) and backend validators (e.g., Spring Validator).

#### Performance and Scalability
- Paginated and filtered APIs for efficient data retrieval.
- Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.

#### API Alignment
1. **Record CRUD APIs**
   - Unified endpoints for managing entities (customers, employees, inventory).
   - Supports actions like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` for comprehensive CRUD operations.

2. **Search and Filter APIs**
   - Allows searching and filtering by various criteria (e.g., name, type, date).

3. **Audit Trail APIs**
   - Provides endpoints for fetching and reviewing historical changes to records.

### 5. Key Workflows and Interactions
1. **Customer Management Workflow**
   - User logs in and navigates to the Customer Management module.
   - Performs operations such as adding a new customer, updating details, or deleting records.
   - Filters and searches for specific customer records using dynamic parameters.

2. **Employee Management Workflow**
   - Admin assigns roles to employees and updates their details.
   - Managers view filtered employee data by department or role.

3. **Inventory Management Workflow**
   - Stock managers update inventory levels and track restocking needs.
   - Alerts generated for items with stock below the defined threshold.

### 6. Assumptions and Constraints
#### Assumptions
- The app will initially support three primary entities: Customers, Employees, and Inventory. Additional entities may be introduced in future phases.
- Users will have predefined roles and permissions configured through the Configuration Management App.

#### Constraints
- Integration with other apps like the Configuration Management App must follow defined API contracts.
- Backend services will adhere to SLA standards for API response times (<500ms for typical requests).

### 7. Deployment and Maintenance
- APIs will be exposed through an API Gateway to ensure secure and centralized access management.
- Logs and metrics will be monitored via the Monitoring & Alerts App for proactive maintenance.

### 8. Conclusion
The Record Management App serves as the backbone of the DanaCore ERP system by enabling seamless data operations and fostering system-wide integration. Its modular and scalable architecture ensures adaptability for SMEs while maintaining robust data security and integrity.
