# User Authentication and Authorization Overview

## 1. Introduction
The User Authentication and Authorization module is a critical component of the Record Management App within the DanaCore ERP system. This module is designed to handle user login, registration, and role-based access control, ensuring secure and efficient management of user access to the application.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 User Authentication
- **User Registration**
  - Allow new users to register with fields such as username, email, password, and role.
- **User Login**
  - Enable users to log in using their username and password.
- **Password Management**
  - Allow users to reset their passwords via email verification.
  - Enable users to change their passwords after logging in.

### 2.2 User Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Define roles such as Admin, Manager, and Employee.
  - Assign permissions to roles to control access to different parts of the application.
- **Access Control**
  - Restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles.
  - Ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., CRUD operations on customer records).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
- Ensure that the authentication process is quick and does not degrade the user experience.
- Optimize authorization checks to minimize performance overhead.

### 3.2 Security
- Implement strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
- Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission.
- Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

## 4. Key Workflows and Interactions
### 4.1 User Registration
1. User navigates to the "Register" page.
2. User fills in the required fields (e.g., username, email, password).
3. User submits the registration form.
4. System validates the input data.
5. System creates a new user account and assigns a default role.
6. System sends a confirmation email to the user.
7. System displays a confirmation message to the user.

### 4.2 User Login
1. User navigates to the "Login" page.
2. User enters their username and password.
3. User submits the login form.
4. System validates the credentials.
5. System generates a JWT token for the user.
6. System redirects the user to the dashboard.

### 4.3 Password Reset
1. User navigates to the "Forgot Password" page.
2. User enters their email address.
3. User submits the form.
4. System sends a password reset link to the user's email.
5. User clicks the link and navigates to the "Reset Password" page.
6. User enters a new password and submits the form.
7. System validates the new password and updates it in the database.
8. System displays a confirmation message to the user.

### 4.4 Role-Based Access Control
1. Admin navigates to the "Manage Roles" page.
2. Admin creates a new role or updates an existing role.
3. Admin assigns permissions to the role.
4. Admin assigns the role to users.
5. System enforces access control based on the assigned roles.

## 5. User Interface Requirements
### 5.1 Screens and Forms
- **Register Page**
  - Fields: Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password.
- **Login Page**
  - Fields: Username, Password.
- **Forgot Password Page**
  - Fields: Email.
- **Reset Password Page**
  - Fields: New Password, Confirm Password.
- **Manage Roles Page**
  - Fields: Role Name, Permissions.
- **User List View**
  - Columns: Username, Email, Role.
  - Actions: Edit, Delete, Assign Role.

### 5.2 Navigation and User Experience
- Ensure intuitive navigation between different screens.
- Provide clear and concise error messages for validation errors.
- Implement responsive design for accessibility on various devices.

## 6. Data Requirements
### 6.1 Data Fields
- **Username**: String, required, unique.
- **Email**: String, required, unique.
- **Password**: String, required.
- **Role**: String, required.

### 6.2 Data Validation Rules
- Ensure that the email field contains a valid email address.
- Ensure that the password field meets complexity requirements.
- Validate that the username and email fields are unique.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints
### 7.1 Assumptions
- Users will have the necessary permissions to perform authentication and authorization tasks.
- The system will integrate with other modules of the DanaCore ERP system for seamless data flow.

### 7.2 Constraints
- The system must adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- The performance of the system should not degrade with an increasing number of user accounts.

## 8. Conclusion
The User Authentication and Authorization module is essential for maintaining secure access to the Record Management App within the DanaCore ERP system. By implementing robust authentication mechanisms, role-based access control, and ensuring data security, this module will provide a reliable foundation for managing user access and permissions.
