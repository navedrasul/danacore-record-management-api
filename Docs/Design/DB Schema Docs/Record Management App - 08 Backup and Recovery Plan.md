# Backup and Recovery Plan

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the backup and recovery procedures for the Record Management App database. This plan ensures that data is regularly backed up and can be restored in the event of data loss, corruption, or other disasters.

5. **Testing and Validation**

## 1. Introduction
The Record Management App database is a critical component of the DanaCore ERP system. To ensure data integrity and availability, it is essential to have a robust backup and recovery plan. This document outlines the procedures for performing regular backups, the methods used, and the steps to recover data in case of an incident.

## 2. Backup Schedule
Regular backups are crucial to minimize data loss. The following schedule is recommended:

- **Full Backup**: Performed weekly on Sundays at 2:00 AM.
- **Incremental Backup**: Performed daily at 2:00 AM, except on Sundays.
- **Transaction Log Backup**: Performed every hour.

### Backup Retention Policy
- **Full Backups**: Retained for 4 weeks.
- **Incremental Backups**: Retained for 1 week.
- **Transaction Log Backups**: Retained for 24 hours.

## 3. Backup Methods
The following methods are used to perform backups:

### Full Backup
A full backup captures the entire database, including all data and schema objects. This type of backup is the foundation for all other backups.

**Procedure**:
1. Connect to the database server.
2. Execute the full backup command:
   ```sql
   BACKUP DATABASE RecordManagementApp TO DISK = 'path_to_backup/RecordManagementApp_Full.bak' WITH INIT;
   ```

### Incremental Backup
An incremental backup captures only the changes made since the last full or incremental backup. This method reduces the amount of data to be backed up and speeds up the process.

**Procedure**:
1. Connect to the database server.
2. Execute the incremental backup command:
   ```sql
   BACKUP DATABASE RecordManagementApp TO DISK = 'path_to_backup/RecordManagementApp_Incremental.bak' WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
   ```

### Transaction Log Backup
A transaction log backup captures all the transactions that have occurred since the last transaction log backup. This method ensures that all changes are recorded and can be replayed during recovery.

**Procedure**:
1. Connect to the database server.
2. Execute the transaction log backup command:
   ```sql
   BACKUP LOG RecordManagementApp TO DISK = 'path_to_backup/RecordManagementApp_Log.trn';
   ```

## 4. Recovery Procedures
In the event of data loss or corruption, the following procedures should be followed to restore the database:

### Full Database Recovery
1. Connect to the database server.
2. Restore the full backup:
   ```sql
   RESTORE DATABASE RecordManagementApp FROM DISK = 'path_to_backup/RecordManagementApp_Full.bak' WITH NORECOVERY;
   ```

### Incremental Recovery
1. After restoring the full backup, restore the latest incremental backup:
   ```sql
   RESTORE DATABASE RecordManagementApp FROM DISK = 'path_to_backup/RecordManagementApp_Incremental.bak' WITH NORECOVERY;
   ```

### Transaction Log Recovery
1. After restoring the full and incremental backups, restore the transaction logs:
   ```sql
   RESTORE LOG RecordManagementApp FROM DISK = 'path_to_backup/RecordManagementApp_Log.trn' WITH RECOVERY;
   ```

## 5. Testing and Validation
Regular testing and validation of the backup and recovery procedures are essential to ensure that the plan works as expected.

### Testing Schedule
- **Quarterly Tests**: Perform a full recovery test every quarter.
- **Annual Tests**: Perform a comprehensive recovery test, including incremental and transaction log recovery, annually.

### Validation Steps
1. Perform a test backup according to the backup schedule.
2. Restore the backup to a test environment.
3. Verify the integrity and completeness of the restored data.
4. Document any issues and update the backup and recovery plan as needed.
