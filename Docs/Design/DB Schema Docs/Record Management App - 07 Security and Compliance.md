# Security and Compliance Document

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the security measures and compliance requirements for the database schema of the Record Management App. This ensures that the database is secure, access is controlled, data is encrypted, and compliance standards are met.

## Contents

### 1. Security Policies
#### 1.1 Data Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to ensure that users have access only to the data necessary for their role.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant the minimum level of access required for users to perform their duties.
- **User Authentication**: Use JWT-based authentication for API access to ensure that only authenticated users can access the database.

#### 1.2 Data Encryption
- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database using AES-256 encryption.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS/SSL to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server.

#### 1.3 Data Masking
- **Masking Sensitive Data**: Implement data masking techniques to hide sensitive data from unauthorized users.

### 2. Access Control
#### 2.1 User Roles and Permissions
- **Admin**: Full access to all data and functionalities.
- **Manager**: Access to data and functionalities relevant to their department.
- **Employee**: Limited access to data and functionalities necessary for their role.

#### 2.2 Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Define ACLs to specify which users or roles have access to specific data and functionalities.

### 3. Data Encryption
#### 3.1 Encryption Algorithms
- **AES-256**: Use AES-256 for encrypting data at rest.
- **TLS/SSL**: Use TLS/SSL for encrypting data in transit.

#### 3.2 Key Management
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate encryption keys to enhance security.
- **Key Storage**: Store encryption keys securely using a key management service (KMS).

### 4. Compliance Standards
#### 4.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- **Data Subject Rights**: Ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights, such as the right to access, rectify, and delete their data.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Implement procedures to notify authorities and affected individuals in the event of a data breach.

#### 4.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Ensure that PHI is securely stored and transmitted.
- **Audit Controls**: Implement audit controls to track access to PHI.

#### 4.3 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- **Cardholder Data Protection**: Ensure that cardholder data is securely stored and transmitted.
- **Access Control Measures**: Implement access control measures to restrict access to cardholder data.

### 5. Monitoring and Auditing
#### 5.1 Logging
- **Access Logs**: Maintain logs of all access to the database, including user ID, timestamp, and actions performed.
- **Error Logs**: Maintain logs of all errors and exceptions encountered in the database.

#### 5.2 Auditing
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with security policies and standards.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain audit trails of all CRUD operations on records to ensure traceability.

### 6. Incident Response
#### 6.1 Incident Detection
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring tools to detect security incidents in real-time.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts to notify administrators of potential security incidents.

#### 6.2 Incident Response Plan
- **Response Procedures**: Define procedures for responding to security incidents, including containment, eradication, and recovery.
- **Communication Plan**: Define a communication plan for notifying stakeholders in the event of a security incident.

### 7. Data Backup and Recovery
#### 7.1 Backup Schedule
- **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups of the database to ensure data can be restored in the event of data loss.

#### 7.2 Backup Storage
- **Secure Storage**: Store backups in a secure location, preferably offsite or in the cloud.

#### 7.3 Recovery Procedures
- **Testing**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure they work as expected.
- **Documentation**: Document backup and recovery procedures to ensure they can be followed in the event of data loss.

### 8. Training and Awareness
#### 8.1 Security Training
- **Regular Training**: Provide regular security training to all users to ensure they understand security policies and procedures.

#### 8.2 Awareness Programs
- **Security Awareness**: Implement security awareness programs to keep users informed about the latest security threats and best practices.
