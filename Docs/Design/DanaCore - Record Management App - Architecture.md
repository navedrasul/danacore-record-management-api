### Record Management App - Architecture  

#### Overview  
The **Record Management App** is a core module of DanaCore ERP, enabling CRUD operations for key business entities like customers, employees, and inventory. It ensures robust data management, efficient interactions, and adherence to security standards.

### **Architecture Layers**  

#### 1. **Frontend Layer**  
**Technology**: React  
- Provides a dynamic and responsive UI for users to manage records.  
- Role-based components for different user types (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).  
- Features:  
  - Search and filter functionalities.  
  - Editable grids for quick inline updates.  
  - Form validation for record creation and updates.  

#### 2. **Backend Layer**  
**Technology**: Spring Boot  
- RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations and business logic.  
- Key modules:  
  - **Controller Layer**: Exposes endpoints for record operations (e.g., `POST /records`, `GET /records/{id}`).  
  - **Service Layer**: Contains business logic like input validation, deduplication, and data consistency checks.  
  - **Repository Layer**: Interacts with the database using Hibernate/JPA.

### **Key Modules**  

#### 1. **Entity Management**  
Entities like `Customer`, `Employee`, and `Inventory` are managed.  
- **Entity Classes**: Represent database tables.  
- **DTOs**: Decouple API responses from entity classes.  

#### 2. **Search and Filters**  
- Dynamic filtering and pagination using database queries (e.g., JPA Specifications).  
- Search fields configurable based on entity type.  

#### 3. **Validation**  
- Backend validation using Spring Validator.  
- Frontend form validation (e.g., `Formik` or `React Hook Form`).  

#### 4. **Audit Trail**  
- Tracks all CRUD operations to ensure compliance and traceability.

### **Database Schema**  

#### Example Tables  
1. **Customers**  
   - `id`: Primary key  
   - `name`: Customer name  
   - `email`: Unique identifier  
   - `created_at`/`updated_at`: Timestamps  

2. **Employees**  
   - `id`: Primary key  
   - `name`: Employee name  
   - `designation`: Job role  

3. **Inventory**  
   - `id`: Primary key  
   - `product_name`: Product name  
   - `stock_quantity`: Current stock  

---

### **API Design**  

1. **Record CRUD Endpoints**  
- `GET /records` (Paginated and Filtered List)  
- `POST /records` (Create Record)  
- `GET /records/{id}` (View Record by ID)  
- `PUT /records/{id}` (Update Record by ID)  
- `DELETE /records/{id}` (Soft Delete Record by ID)  

2. **Search and Filter API**  
- Dynamic filters based on query parameters.  
  Example: `GET /records?type=customer&name=John`  

---

### **Security Features**  
- Role-based access control using Spring Security.  
- Validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS.  
- JWT-based authentication for API access.  

---

### **Deployment Considerations**  
- Containerised using Docker.  
- Deployed via Kubernetes with horizontal scaling enabled.
