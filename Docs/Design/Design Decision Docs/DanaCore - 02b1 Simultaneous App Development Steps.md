To efficiently begin working on the **Record Management App** and **Configuration Management App**, follow these steps:

### **What to Do First for Each App?**
1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Clearly list the functionality of each app. For example:
     - **Record Management App**: CRUD operations for customers, employees, and inventory.
     - **Configuration Management App**: Customisation of workflows, roles, and settings.
   - Identify key workflows and interactions (e.g., adding a new record, updating a workflow).

2. **Choose a Diagram to Create First**:
   - **Start with Sequence Diagrams** for both apps:
     - For **Record Management App**, detail a workflow such as creating a new record (e.g., customer data) and saving it to the database.
     - For **Configuration Management App**, detail a workflow like defining a new role and saving its permissions.
   - Sequence Diagrams help you define interaction flows between components and will guide subsequent steps.

### **Steps to Follow**:
1. **Create Sequence Diagrams**:
   - Focus on core use cases (CRUD operations for Record Management; workflow/role customisation for Configuration Management).
   - Highlight component interactions (e.g., frontend, API Gateway, microservices, database).

2. **Refine Components**:
   - After creating the sequence diagrams, revisit your **Component Diagram**. Ensure it reflects the interactions for these apps accurately.
   - Add new microservices/components if necessary.

3. **Create Class Diagrams**:
   - Once workflows are clear, identify the data entities and their relationships.
   - For **Record Management App**, define classes like `Customer`, `Employee`, and `InventoryItem`.
   - For **Configuration Management App**, define classes like `Workflow`, `Role`, and `Permission`.

4. **Design Database Schema**:
   - Based on the class diagrams, draft the database schema for both apps.
   - This step ensures the backend aligns with the data needs.

5. **Prototype Frontend (Optional at This Stage)**:
   - Sketch or wireframe key UI screens for both apps (e.g., forms for CRUD operations, settings pages for configurations).

---

### Suggested Workflow:
1. Start with **Sequence Diagrams** for both apps.
2. Move to **Class Diagrams** to structure entities.
3. Design the **Database Schema**.
4. Optionally refine your **Component Diagram** and sketch frontends.
