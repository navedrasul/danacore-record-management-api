Build remote workspace index

The recommended approach is to design the Record Management API as a modular, cohesive service rather than splitting each technical layer (controller, service, repository) into separate microservices. In practice, you can implement a single microservice for the Record Management API that internally follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This means:

- **Group by Domain**: Organize functionality into bounded contextsâ€”for example, separate modules within the service for Customer, Employee, and Inventory handling.
- **Modular Monolith**: Within the service, structure the code into clearly separated layers (Controller, Service, Repository) without the overhead of deploying and maintaining many independent services.
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Start with a modular monolith and, if needed, gradually split out specific modules into independent microservices as scalability or autonomous deployment requirements dictate.

This approach minimizes operational complexity while maintaining clear separation of concerns and aligns well with the architectural vision described in [00 About DanaCore with Java - Document Ver 1.5.txt](#file:00 About DanaCore with Java - Document Ver 1.5.txt-context) and [DanaCore - Solution Architecture Description.md](#file:01 DanaCore - Solution Architecture Description.md-context). The detailed interactions in the [Record Management App - Detailed Component Diagram.dot](#file:Record Management App - Detailed Component Diagram.dot-context) further support this design by illustrating domain-specific services interacting with each other rather than isolating every technical component as a separate microservice.

This strategy ensures maintainability, ease of testing, and scalability while avoiding the pitfalls of over-fragmentation in a microservices environment.
