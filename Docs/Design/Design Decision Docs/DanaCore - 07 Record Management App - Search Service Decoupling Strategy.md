Reducing coupling between the Search Service and the various entity databases (Customer DB, Employee DB, etc.) can be achieved through several strategies:

1. **Use of APIs**:
   - Instead of directly querying the databases, the Search Service can interact with the Customer, Employee, and Inventory Services through their respective APIs. This abstracts the database details and reduces direct dependencies.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - Introduce a service layer that acts as an intermediary between the Search Service and the databases. This layer can handle the communication and data retrieval, allowing the Search Service to remain decoupled.

3. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Implement a data aggregation service that periodically collects and consolidates data from the Customer, Employee, and Inventory databases. The Search Service can then query this aggregated data instead of the individual databases.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Use an event-driven architecture where changes in the Customer, Employee, and Inventory databases trigger events. The Search Service can subscribe to these events and update its own data store accordingly.

5. **Caching**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data. This reduces the need for the Search Service to repeatedly query the databases.

### Component Diagram Structure

- **Search Service**:
  - Communicates with:
    - **API Gateway**: Routes requests to the appropriate service (Customer, Employee, Inventory).
    - **Data Aggregation Service**: Provides consolidated data for search queries.
    - **Cache**: Stores frequently accessed data to reduce database queries.

- **API Gateway**:
  - Routes requests to:
    - Customer Service
    - Employee Service
    - Inventory Service

- **Data Aggregation Service**:
  - Collects data from:
    - Customer Database
    - Employee Database
    - Inventory Database

- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
  - Events triggered by changes in:
    - Customer Database
    - Employee Database
    - Inventory Database
  - Search Service subscribes to these events.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the coupling between the Search Service and the individual databases, leading to a more modular and maintainable architecture.
